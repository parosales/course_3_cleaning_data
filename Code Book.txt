Axial signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Meaning:  

 ~ These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
 ~ The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

  1) mean(): Mean value
  2) std(): Standard deviation

- Variables (by groups):
