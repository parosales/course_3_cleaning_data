About this Script (run_analysis.R)
***********************************

# Introduction:  This script constitutes my answer to the "Peer-graded Assignment", that is
#   part of the Coursera MOOC "Getting and Cleaning Data".

# Goal:  To integrate, structure and format the input data to generate a tidy dataset that is 
#   appropriate for it's further analysis.

# Inputs:  
#  1) The dataset of "data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone",  
#     provided by the MOOC instructors, located in the directory given by the input parameter
#     "working_directory_name".

# Outputs:
#  1) A file named "tidy_samsung_data.txt" that contains the tidy data set, located in the 
#     directory working directory given by the input variable <working_directory_name>.

# Usage:
#  1) Locate the input files and directories in the base directory.
#  2) From RStudio, call this script's main function run_analysis(), setting the input parameter with the base directory.
#  3) Wait a couple of seconds until the script ends and generates the output file.

# Assumptions:
#  1) The input data has the exact directories and files as provided by the MOOC instructors.
